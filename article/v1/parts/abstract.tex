  We study in this paper the problem of thematic clustering with background 
  knowledge. To perform $K$-Means with these constraints, we need a 
  representation where data about documents and constraints are present. For this 
  reason, deep K-Mean can be used to learn a latent space showing all constraints,
  and perform $K$-Means in the latent space.
