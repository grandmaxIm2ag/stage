\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Clustering is one of the most fundamental tasks in data mining and machine
learning. $K$-Means algorithm is a clustering method using centroid models,
it represents each cluster by a single mean vector. $K$-Means clustering sorts
n objects into k clusters in which each observation belongs to
the cluster with the nearest centroid. This problem is computationally
difficult (NP-hard).
In real application domains, users may want to introduce constraints to finding 
useful properties for clustering data. The difficulty with integration of 
constraints into $K$-Means algorithm is to find a good representation for data 
taking into account constraints. The Deep Learning and Auto-Encoder can be used 
to learn this representation. With Auto-Encoder we have to perform the $K$-Means 
in the latent space learned.
\\The major contribution to this work, is to propose a constrained Deep $K$-Means 
taking account into ML and CL constraints and lexical constraints.
\\In the next section, we provide some background on the $K$-Means algorithm and 
deep learning. In section 3, we proposed a method to introduce constraints to 
the $K$-Means algorithm. And we are experimenting our method in section 4.
