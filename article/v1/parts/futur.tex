\section{Futur Work}
In futur work, we plan to test pairwise constraints(Eq \ref{eq:omegaML}, 
\ref{eq:omegaCL}).
To test these  constraints, we usee need another baseline algorithm. For
lexical constraint we only used deep $K$-Means algorithm. We can use this
algorithm, but we have to also use algorithm taking into account pair. We can 
use COP$K$-Means algorithm like baseline. To test the integration of pairwise
constraints and lexical constraints we can use an alternative form of the 
COP$K$-Means algoritm. We learn a $k$-means friendly space taking into account 
lexical constraints. The loss function for this model is :
\begin{equation}
  Min~L(KW, C, K; \theta) = (L_{rec}(C, \theta) + \omega_{KW} )+
  \lambda L_{clust}(C,K)
\end{equation}
