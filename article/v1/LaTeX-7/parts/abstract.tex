  We study in this paper the problem of thematic clustering with a prior
  knowledge. To perform K-Means with these constraints we need a representation
  where informations about documents and constraints are present. For this
  reason, deep $K$-Mean can be use to learn a latent space  showing all
  constraints, and perform $K$-Means in the latent space.
