    abstract = { The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms are usually regarded as independent. It is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term meaning. The effects on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that frequently‐occurring terms are required for good overall performance. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure. }

@article{NMI_ACC,
title = "Locally consistent concept factorization for document clustering",
abstract = "Previous studies have demonstrated that document clustering performance can be improved significantly in lower dimensional linear subspaces. Recently, matrix factorization-based techniques, such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Concept Factorization (CF), have yielded impressive results. However, both of them effectively see only the global euclidean geometry, whereas the local manifold geometry is not fully considered. In this paper, we propose a new approach to extract the document concepts which are consistent with the manifold geometry such that each concept corresponds to a connected component. Central to our approach is a graph model which captures the local geometry of the document submanifold. Thus, we call it Locally Consistent Concept Factorization (LCCF). By using the graph Laplacian to smooth the document-to-concept mapping, LCCF can extract concepts with respect to the intrinsic manifold structure and thus documents associated with the same concept can be well clustered. The experimental results on TDT2 and Reuters-21578 have shown that the proposed approach provides a better representation and achieves better clustering results in terms of accuracy and mutual information.",

abstract = "Optimization means the provision of a set of numerical parameter values which will give the best fit of an equation, or series of equations, to a set of data. For simple systems this can be done by differentiating the equations with respect to each parameter in turn, setting the set of partial differential equations to zero, and solving this set of simultaneous equations (as for exwnple in linear regression). In more complicated cases, however, it may be impossible to differentiate the equations, or very difficultly soluble non-linear equations may result. Many numerical optimization techniques to overcome these difficulties have been developed in the least ten years, and this review explains the logical basis of most of them, without going into the detail of computational procedures. The methods fall naturally into two classes — direct search methods, in which only values of the function to be minimized (or maximized) are used — and gradient methods, which also use derivatives of the function. The author considers all the accepted methods in each class, although warning that gradient methods should not be used unless the analytical differentiation of the function to be minimized is possible. If the solution is constrained, that is, certain values of the parameters are regarded as impossible or certain relations between the parameter values must be obeyed, the problem is more difficult. The second part of the review considers methods which have been proposed for the solution of constrained optimization problems."
