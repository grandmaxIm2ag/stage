\section{Conclusion}
We have presented and tested in this study an approach to integrate lexical 
constraints to the $K$-Means algorithm by introducing in the non clustering 
loss penalties biasing the representation. To  the best of our knowledge, this 
is the first approach that integrates lexical constraints to the $K$-Means 
algorithm.
