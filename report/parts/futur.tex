\section{Future Work}
In future works, we plan to add priorities to classes In other words, we would like some classes
to be more important than others, to bias clustering to some classes considered more
important by the user.
\\Also, because users do not always know the entire corpus of
documents, it might be useful to add a trash class system that groups documents
that have no links to the user's given keyword classes.
\\In addition, the
initialization of the centers is only taking into account keywords, we could use
a similarity function and initialize the centers with the words closest to the
keywords in the corpus.
\\Finally, one of the major problems of our algorithm is
that we can not use as keywords only words present in the corpus, nevertheless
it is possible that the user wants to give keywords that are not part of corpus.
To do this, we could use words embedding \cite{2013arXiv1301.3781M}.
Words embedding are continuous vector representations of words from very large 
datasets.
