\section{Future Works}
In future works, we plan to test pairwise constraints(Eq \ref{eq:omegaML}, 
\ref{eq:omegaCL}).
To test these  constraints, we need another baseline algorithm. For
lexical constraint we only used deep $K$-Means algorithm. We can use this
algorithm, but we have to also use algorithm taking into account pair. We can 
use COP$K$-Means algorithm like baseline.\\ 
To test the integration of pairwise constraints with lexical constraints we can 
use an alternative form of the  COP$K$-Means algorithm. We learn a $k$-means 
friendly space taking into account lexical constraints and perform COP$K$-Means
in the learned latent space. The loss function for this model is :
\begin{equation}
  Min~L(KW, C, K; \theta) = (L_{rec}(C, \theta) + \omega_{KW} )+
  \lambda.L_{Clust}(X, K;R, \theta)
\end{equation}
Then, we can test the robustness of our model in different ways.
First we can change the number of extracted keywords by class, in
our tests, we extracted 3 keywords by class, but we can imagine, experiments 
where the number of keywords is higher or lower, or where the number of 
extracted keywords for each class is different. Then we can change the number
of clusters.
